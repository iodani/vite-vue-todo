## ‚ú® Key Features

The application includes a comprehensive set of features for effective task management:

*   **Task Management:**
    *   **Add Tasks:** Quickly create new tasks from the main input field.
    *   **Edit Tasks:** Modify the text of an existing task by clicking the edit icon.
    *   **Mark as Complete:** Toggle a task's status (pending/completed) using the checkbox. The task's visual style changes to reflect its status.
    *   **Delete Tasks:** Remove individual tasks with a single click.

*   **Display & Filtering:**
    *   **Dynamic Filters:** View all tasks, only **active** ones (*labeled 'Earrings' in the code*), or only **completed** ones.
    *   **Task Counters:** See at a glance how many tasks are pending and how many have been completed.

*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   **Local Storage:** Your tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so you won't lose them when you reload the page or close the browser.

*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   **Light & Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for visual comfort. Your preference is saved and syncs with your system's OS setting on the first visit.
    *   **Responsive Design:** The application adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
    *   **Smart Empty States:** Displays helpful messages when there are no tasks to show based on the selected filter.
    *   **Clean Interface:** Built with `shadcn-vue` components and `Tailwind CSS` for a modern and consistent look.
